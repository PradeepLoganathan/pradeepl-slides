# The Rise of Agentic AI

## A New Era of Intelligent Automation

- **Explosive Growth of AI-Driven Applications:**
  - Demand for immediate insights and decisions is paramount.
  - AI algorithms analyze vast data quickly, enabling predictive insights.
- **Exponential Increase in Connected Endpoints:**
  - Over the last 5 years, endpoints accessing applications have doubled.
  - Projections: Upwards of 1 trillion endpoints by 2030.
  - By 2025, 75% of IoT data will be processed at the edge, reducing latency.
- **The Imperative for Instant Value:**
  - Clients expect timely value; delays impact retention and market position.
  - Financial repercussions: Some businesses report losses over $500,000 for a single hour of outage.
  - Even 10% latency increase can significantly degrade user experience.

# What is Agentic AI?

### Autonomous, Context-Aware, and Action-Oriented Services
- **Definition:** Autonomous services executing intelligent, long-running workflows.
- They call Large Language Models (LLMs), process responses, and execute actions.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Durable Execution:** Workflows complete reliably.
- **Context Retention:** Agents maintain context across interactions.
- **Coordination:** Adaptability and distributed coordination.
- **Tool Use:** Integration with databases, APIs, and enterprise systems.

### The Challenge:
- Dependency on failure-prone services and high-latency LLMs.

# The Demands of Agentic AI
## Why Traditional Approaches Fall Short

- **Resilience & Durability:**
  - Traditional error handling fails in distributed systems.
- **Performance & Responsiveness:**
  - Blocking communication and "cold start" issues.
- **State Management:**
  - Stateless serverless complexity with external databases.
- **Scalability & Elasticity:**
  - Poor resource management under dynamic loads.
- **Operational Complexity & Cost:**
  - High infrastructure costs and technical debt.

# Introducing the Actor Model
## Foundation for Agentic AI

- **Core Concept:**
  - Actors: lightweight, isolated, asynchronous messaging.
- **Reactive Principles:**
  - Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, Message-driven.
- **Advantages:**
  - No shared mutable state, efficient concurrency, encapsulation.

# Actor Model for Resilience
- **Hierarchical Supervision:**
  -   Fault isolation and automated recovery.
- **Failure as Domain Model:**
  -   Graceful error handling.
- **Self-Healing Systems:**
  -   Built-in recovery and workload replication.
- **Benefit:**
  -   Durable workflows amidst external failures.
