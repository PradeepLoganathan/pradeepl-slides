# Overview of APRA
### What is APRA?
- Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
- Regulates banking, insurance, and superannuation sectors

### Purpose
- APRA's primary purpose is to ensure the stability of Australia's financial system and protect depositors, policyholders, and superannuation fund members. [cite: 40, 43]
- It works in tandem with other regulatory bodies, including the Australian Treasury, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). [cite: 41]

# APRA’s Consultation Process

- Collaborative approach to ensure compliance and risk management

### Steps

- The level of consultation required depends on the materiality and risk assessment of the activity. [cite: 57, 58]
    - Low Risk: No consultation required. [cite: 57, 58]
    - Heightened Risk: Consultation after internal governance processes. [cite: 57, 58]
    - Extreme Risk: Early consultation is encouraged. [cite: 57, 58]
- Any impact on a Material Business Activity requires consultation with APRA. [cite: 57, 58]
