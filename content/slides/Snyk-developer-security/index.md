<!-- Slide 2 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
Opening Statement: "For organizations building their future on software innovation, integrating security into development processes is no longer optional—it’s a necessity. This is where the concept of 'shift-left security' becomes crucial. Let’s consider the forces reshaping the way we develop and deploy software"

Key Point 1 - DevOps: "In the DevOps world, rapid iteration and deployment leave no room for traditional security practices that involve stopping to audit. Security needs to be embedded directly into the development process to match the pace of DevOps."

Key Point 2 - Cloud: "As cloud adoption grows, infrastructure security is shifting to become developer-driven. Developers now define and manage the infrastructure, which means security practices must be baked into their workflows and tools."

Key Point 3 - AI: "With the rise of generative AI tools creating code, often with minimal developer supervision, the risk of introducing vulnerabilities increases. AI-powered development must be supported with robust security measures to ensure the code remains safe."

These transformative trends—DevOps for speed, Cloud for scale, and AI for innovation—make security an integral part of development. Let’s explore why shift-left security is more critical than ever.

<!-- Slide 3 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
Conclusion: "This is why shift-left security is more critical than ever—security needs to be fast, integrated, and developer-friendly to keep pace with these transformative trends."

Suggested Discovery Questions:
Are your developers leveraging gen AI tools to write code faster?
What are you doing to secure the use of AI?

<!-- Slide 5 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
Opening Statement: "The AI revolution is transforming how developers build software. However, with this revolution comes the need for a fundamental shift in how we approach security. Trusted developer security is no longer optional—it's essential."

Key Statistic 1 - Developer Adoption: "92% of developers are already using AI-generated code in some capacity. This shows how quickly AI tools like GitHub Copilot are being adopted to accelerate development."

Key Statistic 2 - Development Speed: "AI is projected to double the speed of development, enabling teams to ship features faster than ever before. But speed without security introduces risk."

Key Statistic 3 - Vulnerabilities in AI-Generated Code: "However, 40% of programs generated by Copilot have shown vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of integrating security tools into the AI-driven development lifecycle. For example, GitHub Copilot can suggest insecure code patterns if trained on unsafe data. Similarly, large language models can inadvertently leak sensitive information in generated code."

Call to Action: "To fully leverage the AI revolution while protecting your business, it’s critical to ensure that developer security is embedded into the tools and workflows that developers are already using."

<!-- Slide 6 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
Opening Statement: "As organizations scale their application security efforts, they face growing challenges. The complexity and pace of development make it increasingly difficult to stay ahead of risk. Let’s explore some of the key questions security teams are grappling with today."

Question 1 - Finding Risks Early: "Am I finding risks soon enough? Can I fix them fast enough? The longer a vulnerability remains undiscovered, the higher the cost and potential impact. Teams need tools that can surface risks at the earliest stages of development."

Question 2 - Overwhelming Vulnerabilities: "In a sea of vulnerabilities, can I even see them all? And where do we focus? The sheer volume of issues can be overwhelming, making prioritization essential. Organizations must focus on the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest business risk."

Question 3 - Scaling AppSec: "With compounding development, can AppSec scale? Can I prove it’s working? As development accelerates, security needs to scale alongside it while providing measurable outcomes to justify investments."

Question 4 - Developer Adoption: "Will developers actually use our security tools? Security solutions must be intuitive and integrate seamlessly into developer workflows. Without adoption, even the best tools fail to deliver value."

Conclusion: "These challenges underscore the need for a new approach to application security—one that aligns with the pace of development while providing actionable insights and measurable outcomes."

<!-- Slide 7 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
**Opening Statement**:
"Organizations today are adopting various approaches to address application security challenges. However, many of the current solutions fall short in effectively enabling secure and fast development. Let's take a closer look at the two dominant types of solutions and their limitations."

**Legacy Security Tool Vendors**:
- "Legacy tools were designed for a different era. They focus heavily on finding vulnerabilities but fail to provide actionable remediation."
- **Key Challenges**:
  - "They are disconnected from remediation workflows, leaving teams without clear paths to fix vulnerabilities."
  - "Poor developer experience leads to low adoption, making these tools ineffective in practice."
  - "They generate more noise than actionable insights, overwhelming teams with alerts that lack prioritization."

** I know of how a major telecom provider struggled with legacy security tools that failed to integrate into their CI/CD pipelines, leading to delayed fixes and friction with developers.

**Developer Tool Vendors**:
- "On the other hand, developer-focused tools lack the security depth and enterprise-grade capabilities needed for effective application security at scale."
- **Key Challenges**:
  - "Weak security research means they often miss critical vulnerabilities or misprioritize issues."
  - "Limited integrations create silos, preventing teams from having a unified view of their security posture."
  - "A lack of robust reporting and risk management features makes it difficult for organizations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their security efforts."

**Conclusion**:
"Neither legacy security tools nor developer-focused tools can fully address today’s application security needs. This is why organizations must look for solutions that combine deep security expertise with seamless integration into developer workflows—solutions like Snyk."

<!-- Slide 8 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
**Key Point**:
"This brings us to the core issue: without the right approach, there is no reliable path to delivering trusted software at the speed required by modern development. The gaps left by existing tools—whether it's the lack of actionable insights, limited integrations, or poor developer adoption—make it nearly impossible to move fast and stay secure."

**Conclusion**:
"This is why a new approach is needed—one that integrates seamlessly into developer workflows, provides actionable remediation, and scales with the pace of modern development. Snyk bridges these gaps, enabling organizations to deliver trusted software quickly and effectively."

Suggested Discovery Questions:
How many appsec tools are you currently using? Which ones?
With your current tooling, how do you bring everything together to
understand your security footprint?

<!-- Slide 10 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
**Shift-left Developer Security**:
"At the core of delivering trusted software is shift-left developer security. This approach ensures that security starts at the developer level—right in the tools and workflows they are already using. By empowering developers to find and fix issues early, we reduce risks before they even reach production."
-->
![bg center 100%](./images/Slide10.png)

---

<!-- Slide 11 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
**Comprehensive Governance Capabilities**:
"The next layer focuses on governance, which is critical to scaling security efforts across teams. Comprehensive governance capabilities unite developers and security professionals, creating a unified approach to application security. This ensures that as your development scales, your security processes scale with it."
-->
![bg center 100%](./images/Slide11.png)

---

<!-- Slide 12 -->
<!-- Speaker notes:
**Holistic Application Risk Management**:
"The final layer expands into application risk management. This is where businesses can gain a clear view of actual risks, prioritize them effectively, and address the issues that matter most to the organization. By focusing on real business risks, teams can ensure their efforts deliver the greatest impact."

**The Path to Trusted Software**:
"When combined, these layers—shift-left developer security, governance, and risk management—form a complete solution for delivering trusted software. This approach enables secure, code-to-cloud development, unites teams under shared governance practices, and provides a clear understanding of application risks."
